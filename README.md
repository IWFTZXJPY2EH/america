### What is going on here?

Americans regardless of their political affiliation can agree on many things to make the country a better place but those shared hopes can be ignored when focusing on differences. Progress can start by agreeing on a small and distinct set of ideas that **most** Americans believe to be good. This is not meant to be an exhaustive list, but rather a starting point where a majority of Americans can find common ground with each other.
